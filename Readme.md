# Medicine Management System (Java Console Application)

The Medicine Management System is a robust, modular, and console-based Java application developed to manage personal or patient-centric medication schedules. This system offers functionality to record, update, monitor, and remind users about their daily medicines in a structured and conflict-free manner. It provides a real-world solution tailored for patients, caregivers, and healthcare support systems that need lightweight, portable, and reliable medicine tracking without the overhead of a complex GUI or cloud infrastructure.

## Overview

This project simulates a medicine tracking system designed to:

- Record medicines with associated dose schedules.
- Notify users about upcoming doses in real-time.
- Track changes and generate a full history of actions.
- Prevent conflicting dose timings.
- Provide a user-friendly console-based interface.

The goal is to offer an efficient solution for individuals or caregivers who need to manage regular medications in a structured way. The system ensures reliability, clarity, and safety through strict scheduling validation and background processing for timely reminders.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Medicine Schedule Management
- Add, update, and delete medicines.
- Assign schedules based on specific days (e.g., Monday, Wednesday).
- Support for multiple dose times per day (e.g., 8:00 AM, 3:30 PM).
- Schedule validation to prevent timing conflicts across medicines.

### 2. Background Dose Reminder
- A background thread continuously checks for upcoming doses.
- Sends real-time console notifications as soon as a scheduled time is reached.

### 3. Historical Logging
- Every action (add/update/delete) is timestamped.
- Maintains a complete history of changes for accountability and audit purposes.

### 4. Console-Based User Interface
- Uses ANSI escape codes for structured color-coded output (platform-independent).
- Simple and intuitive menu-driven interaction.

---

## Technical Specifications

- **Language:** Java (JDK 17+ recommended)
- **Data Structures:** ArrayList, HashMap, LocalDate, LocalTime
- **Concurrency:** Java Threads
- **I/O Handling:** `Scanner`, `System.out`, `ANSI escape codes`
- **Time Management:** `java.time` API

---

## System Architecture

The system consists of three core classes:

1. **Medicine.java**
   - Acts as the main entry point.
   - Controls user interaction through a menu.
   - Initializes a background thread for dose notification.
   - Handles CRUD operations on medicines.
   - Manages logs and history display.

2. **MedicineSchedule.java**
- Manages medicine dose schedules including number of doses, timings, and days.
- Implements conflict resolution to prevent overlapping time slots across medicines.
- Stores existing time slots globally to avoid clashes when new medicines are added.
- Provides a real-time notifier to remind users of scheduled doses based on current time and day.
- Supports user input for fully customizable scheduling using createScheduleFromInput() method.

Each class is self-contained, follows object-oriented principles, and communicates using clearly defined methods to ensure modularity and maintainability.

---

## Functional Modules

### 1. Medicine Registration
Allows users to input:
- Medicine name
- Dosage details (e.g., 500mg)
- Schedule: Days (Mondayâ€“Sunday), Dose Times (in 24-hr format)

### 2. Updation
- The Update function allows you to update medicine 
- The updateSchedule is used to update the schedule of the existing medicine

### 3. Schedule Validation
- Checks if a new medicine conflicts with existing scheduled times.
- Prevents two medicines from being taken at the exact same time on the same day.

### 4. Notifications Engine
- Runs as a background thread.
- Uses the system clock to trigger alerts when a dose time matches the current time.
- Efficient and lightweight, with a one-minute interval for checks.

### 5. History Tracking
- Every action is stored with a timestamp.
- Accessible via the menu for reviewing past changes or debugging.

### 6. View Schedule
- The medicies that are added, their schedule will be displayed

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java SDK 17 or higher installed
- Any IDE or terminal that supports Java console applications
